* Abstract
  Today's encryption algorithms (the process of securing data) exploit
  the inability of modern computers to factorize large integers. If a
  classical algorithm can generate prime factors very quickly,
  the security of our systems would be undermined. As such, we present
  here thoughts on factoring and a theorem to prove relationships between
  factors.
* Introduction
  While delivering fast food for a restaurant, I was in my car a lot just
  thinking while I drove. Throughout 2019 I became more and more intrigued
  with factoring numbers. I had developed a computer model which factored
  numbers as fast as I knew how and over and over thought of ways to speed up
  that algorithm. It did well, but when the numbers were in the billions to trillions, it
  took an insane amount of time to factor. Usually with numbers that large, I never
  saw the algorithm complete.

  This work is built off the wonderful ideas of discrete mathematics I learned in my Discrete
  Mathematics I & II classes at BYU-Idaho. Much thanks to Lee Barney and Rick Neff for teaching
  me mathematics in such a way that has left my mind pondering and hungering for more.

  On my food deliveries, I thought of different operations that could be performed to
  compute the factors of a number.



** Given a natural number \(n\)
  The following algorithms list my attempts and the number of critical operations performed to compute the factors
  of a number. By critical I mean operations like division, modulus, multiplication, and arithmetic with
  values greater than 1. Adding or subtracting one to a value is a very quick process and will not be reported.
  At the beginning, each attempt explains a brief overview of the algorithm.

  NOTE these quantity amounts for how many operations performed are for factoring a number instead of
  finding the prime factorization of a number. Also, the operations to save the factors of the number when
  found are not included, yet may be discussed in the summary.
  The nitty-gritty operations of computing those factors is the main performance bottleneck.

*** To get the next factor

  *First attempt*

  /Summary:/ Start with potential factor \(f\) at \(n\). If \(f\) mod \(n = 0\), meaning f divides n, (written as \(f | n\)),
  then \(f\) is a factor of \(n\). Decrement \(f\) by one each time until \(f = 1\) and that is the last factor of \(n\).

  /Critical Operations:/
  - \(n \) \minus \(1\) modulo operations
  - \(n \) \minus \(1\) condition checks
  - \(n\) iterations

  *Second attempt*

  /Summary:/ Start with potential factor \(f\) at \(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\). If \(f\) mod \(n = 0\), meaning f divides n, (written as \(f | n\)),
  then \(f\) is a factor of \(n\). To get it's counterpart factor, the value where \(f\cdot x\) for some integer \(x\) equals \(n\), integer divide
  \(n\) by \(f\). Since \(f\) is a factor in this iteration, \(\frac{n}{f}\) will produce the same value as the integer division.
  Decrement \(f\) by one each time until \(\frac{n}{f} \gt f\), which means we have found all the factor pairs.

  /Critical Operations:/
  - \(1\) integer divide
  - \(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) modulo operations
  - \(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\) floating-point divisions
  - \(2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\) condition checks
  - \(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\) iterations

  *Third attempt*

  /Summary:/ Start with potential factor \(f\) at \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\). If \(f\) mod \(n = 0\), meaning f divides n, (written as \(f | n\)),
  then \(f\) is a factor of \(n\). To get it's counterpart factor, the value where \(f\cdot x\) for some integer \(x\) equals \(n\), integer divide
  \(n\) by \(f\). Since \(f\) is a factor in this iteration, \(\frac{n}{f}\) will produce the same value as the integer division.
  Decrement \(f\) by one each time until \(f = 1\), which is the last factor.

  /Critical Operations:/
  - \(1\)  \(\sqrt{n}\) computation
  - \(1\) truncation of a floating-point value
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) modulo operations
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) condition checks
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) iterations

  *Fourth attempt*

  /Summary:/ Start with potential factor \(f\) at \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\). If \(\frac{n}{f}\) when truncated (meaning all decimals are chopped off
  making the decimal a whole number) has the same value as \(\frac{n}{f}\), then \(f | n\) and is a factor. The division
  is the counterpart factor.
  Decrement \(f\) by one each time until \(f = 1\), which is the last factor.

  /Critical Operations:/
  - \(1\)  \(\sqrt{n}\) computation
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) floating-point division
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) truncations of a floating-point value
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) condition checks
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) iterations

  *Final attempt*

  /Summary:/ This is the algorithm I have been and will be talking the most about. It goes like this.
  Everything will be retained as fractions using fractional arithmetic instead of floating-point arithmetic.
  Later I will give an explanation how I held the fractions. Start \(y_k\) at \(\frac{n}{1}\). \(k\) will go from
  \(1\) to \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) and this algorithm will relate \(y_k\) to k, as counterpart factor pairs of \(n\). To check if
  \(y_k\) is a factor with counterpart factor \(k\), check if the numerator in \(y_k\) is divisible by its denominator.
  If so, evaluate the fraction using integer division to get the integer factor of \(y_k\). That means \(k\) is also a factor.
  The next potential factor, \(y_{k+1} = y_k\) \minus \(\frac{y_k}{k+1}\), which you will see proven later. Each \(y_k = y_{k-1} \) \minus \(\frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\).
  Continue checking if the next \(y_k\) computed is a factor. Go until \(y_k\) has a numerator that is less than the denominator.
  That will denote that \(k \gt \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) and we are done factoring.

  /Critical Operations:/
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\times5 + 1\) multiplications
  - \(2\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) condition checks
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) modulo operations
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) \minus \(1\) integer division operations
  - \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) iterations

  We will summarize the results of this final attempt later and explain its limitations.

* Motivation
  As you can see, the final attempt algorithm takes considerable more operations. It is by far the slowest of them all.
  I will admit that. But, what we learn from this algorithm can enhance our understanding and uncover
  insights into the relationships of numbers that we have not before seen or considered.

  Factoring is all about finding relationships between numbers. This algorithm I will propose, the slowest attempt, shows us
  the following relationships between numbers.

  Given some natural number \(n\), lets say we wanted to find the real number \(y\) needed such that \(x \cdot y = n\) for
  counting values of \(x\) from 1 to the \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\). Lets consider an example:

** Example
  Let \(n = 36\). I want to find the value needed such that

  \(1 \cdot y_1 = n\) and

  \(2 \cdot y_2 = n\) and

  \(3 \cdot y_3 = n\) and

  \(4 \cdot y_4 = n\) and

  \(5 \cdot y_5 = n\) and

  \(6 \cdot y_6 = n\).

  Well, I can just compute \(\frac{n}{1}, \frac{n}{2}, ..., \frac{n}{6}\) to find the values of \(y_k\) where \(k = 1, 2, ..., \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\).

  But what if there was some interesting relationship between those values of \(y_k\) - that I could find the next value
  \(y_{k+1} \) without needing to even use \(n\) in my equation?

  There is a way! Take the previous \(y_{k-1}\) and subtract the division of \(y_{k-1}\) by \(k, k\) being the integer counting value below the square root of \(n\).

  \(y_{k} = y_{k-1} \) \minus \(\frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\).

  Where do we start for our value of \(y_k\)? \(y_1 = \frac{n}{1} = n\) which should hopefully seem obvious.

  That is all we need to get this recurrence relation going. A recurrence relation is a recursive relation where
  the next value can be computed based on the previous values. Unlike functions like \(\sin{x}\) where they don't
  require knowledge of previous values computed, recurrences relations have the form

  \(a_{k} = c \cdot a_{k-1} + b\) or something with the previously value generating the next value.

  Our recurrence relation is

  \(y_{k} = y_{k-1} \) \minus \(\frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\).

  Let's see it work for our example.

  \(y_2 = y_1\) \minus \(\frac{y_1}{2} = 36\) \minus \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\).

  \(y_3 = y_2\) \minus \(\frac{y_2}{3} = 18\) \minus \(\frac{18}{3} = 18\) \minus \(6 = 12\), and sure enough \(3 \cdot 12 = 36\)

  \(y_{4} = y_3\) \minus \(\frac{y_3}{4} = 12\) \minus \(\frac{12}{4} = 12\) \minus \(3 = 9\), and sure enough \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\)

  \(y_5 = y_4\) \minus \(\frac{y_4}{5} = 9\) \minus \(\frac{9}{5} = 7\frac{1}{5}\), and sure enough \(5 \cdot 7\frac{1}{5} = 36\)

  \(y_6 = y_5\) \minus \(\frac{y_5}{6} = 7\frac{1}{5}\) \minus \(\frac{7\frac{1}{5}}{6} = 7\frac{1}{5}\) \minus \(\frac{36}{30} = 6\), and sure enough \(6 \cdot 6 = 36\)

  Isn't that fascinating? It seemed like magic to me at first. But the more I thought about it and tried to prove it in my mind and in writing,
  the more basic the problem became. It became more and more obvious that this recurrence works. But at first, this algorithm seemed like
  a gold mine that hadn't been discovered before!

** Relationships Uncovered - Usefulness
  From this algorithm and theorem we uncover some interesting relationships:
  - The next integer in the counting sequence up to \(\lfloor\sqrt(n)\rfloor\) has a scalar value
    \(y_k\) where \(y_k = y_{k-1} \) \minus \(\frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\) where \(y_k\) and \(k\) were defined early.

    /Remark:/ This is interesting because usually we think of possible factors or multiplication values (\(k \cdot y_k\) needed to equal a certain value \(n\)
    as usually found by just dividing \(n\) by \(k\). Now we have another relationship in our tool belt of mathematical facts that the
    next value has a scalar multiple of \(y_{k-1}\) \minus \(\frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\) with no need to know the value of \(n\).

  - If \(y_k\) is an integer (whole number), then we are guaranteed that \(y_k\) is a factor of \(n\).

    /Remark:/ This is what really intrigued me at first. Who would have thought that through this recurrence algorithm, you can find all the factors
    of a number. It was extremely weird and fascinating to me. The algorithm goes about computing numbers in the middle of the algorithm that
    don't even seem related to \(n\). And indeed, if someone just saw values of \(y_k\) without knowing where they came from, they would have no clue
    like me how they relate to a common number. Yet, majestically from fractions arise whole number factors of \(n\). Though we may hit a long
    run of non-factors of a number through this algorithm (like say \(n = 124897238\)), this algorithm will produce every whole number factor of 124897238
    only using 124897238 for one iteration, the first iteration.

  - A prime number \(p\) will have no whole number values for \(y_k\) except \(y_1\).

    /Remark:/ I am greatly interested in prime numbers and uncovering relationships about them that may unlock doors to finding quicker methods
    of doing computation with prime numbers or factorizing them. The RSA Cryptosystem is what keeps our technology world secure today. It exploits
    the inability of a modern computer to factor very large integers (thousands of digits long). Thus, if an algorithm can factor numbers by computation
    instead of iteration (looping through a bunch of values to find possible answers), then our security systems will vanish in safety. Many bright
    minds have put their heads into trying to find such quick algorithms for finding prime factorizations but no one has been able to find
    some quick formula that will generate the prime factor.

    /Aside:/ Prime factorization is a number theory algorithm which finds the prime factors of a number. For example, 15 can be written as the
    product of two prime factors: 5 and 3. 36 can be written as \(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2\).

  - The last \(y_k\) before \(k \gt \lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\) will be a very rough yet close estimate of the \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\).

    /Remark:/ As you may have noticed, two of the other factoring attempts use the \(\sqrt{n}\). If you look into the code though, the algorithms compute
    the square root, creating some decimal value, only to truncate the decimal digits and create a whole number. This algorithm doesn't use the slow
    operations of square root and division to compute the next \(y_k\). It only uses multiplication and subtraction, which I think is an interesting
    combination. Remember, division is just repeated subtraction as multiplication is just repeated addition.

    The algorithm I found computes the integer square root when the final fraction \(y_k\) is evaluated using integer division. I
    tried this out for values 1 - 100 and the algorithm correctly computed the integer square root of that value. What's interesting
    is that it does so without using the square root or checking if the integer square root worked. This makes sense because the stopping
    condition, explained below, happens naturally when our \(k\) counter goes above the
    \(\sqrt{n}\). Thus the last \(k\) is the integer square root of \(n\) and \(y_k\) is also the integer square root of \(n\).

    If this algorithm can be enhanced, it will be faster than the floating-point square root algorithm. All factors of a number, both prime or not, can be found
    by iterating over values of \(y_k\) without needing to compute \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\).

  - Easy stopping condition. To stop, all we need to check is if the fraction \(y_k\) is less than 1 (meaning the denominator is
    greater than the numerator.

    /Remark:/ The computer model I used mainted absolute precision by representing the \(y_k\) values as fractions instead
    of a floating-point value. This means that instead of round off errors (because computers only hold a finite number of decimals)
    the arithmetic operations are exact because any fractions are not evaluated (turned into a decimal value). The arithmetic
    of \(y_k = y_{k-1} - \frac{y_{k-1}}{k}\) is held precise, as fractions, until the last \(y_k\) when then and only then we evaluate the fraction.
    That final evaluation is a very rough estimate of the square root of \(n\) and when truncated, as explained previously using integer division,
    produces the integer square root of the number.

* Theorem and Proof
  Author: Benjamin Hansen
** Theorem
  Let \(n \in \mathbb{n}\) For \(k\) = 1, \dots, \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), let \(a_k\) be the real number
  such that \(a_{k}k = n\). The numbers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}\) satisfy the recurrence relation

  \(a_k = a_{k-1} \)\minus\( \frac{a_{k-1}}{k}\)

** /Proof/
   By definition, \(a_{k}k = n\) and \(a_{k-1}(k-1)=n\) and thus \(a_k k=a_{k-1}(k-1)\).
   Dividing both sides by \(k\) gives \(a_k = \frac{k-1}{k}a_{k-1} = (1\) \minus \(\frac{1}{k})a_{k-1} = a_{k-1}\) \minus \(\frac{a_{k-1}}{k}. \square\)

* Computer Model

The following code are the methods and the attempts created to speed up factoring numbers. The programming language
is Erlang, a popular highly-scalable, massively parallel programming system.

It calls functions in a fractions module (library) that is imported at the top. I created this and will
include the functions after this code block.

To maintain ultimate precision with no round off errors, it is necessary sometimes to use a fraction library.
Currently the algorithm I use relies solely upon the fraction library to operate completely and exactly.
In the future I will experiment and research a way to use floating-point arithmetic and division to speed up
the process, but when I first tried, the round off errors were very great and difficult to know when to round and when
not too. But with the fraction library, things work perfectly. A major limitation of using fractions for all the computations
will be explained in the *Limitations* section.

* Limitations
  As we have already discussed, this algorithm I have presented is the slowest algorithm out of the 5 algorithms
  I have experimented with to compute factors of numbers. Why? Because it not only has many more arithmetic operations
  to perform at each loop, if we were to check if the fraction \(y_k\) was a factor of the number, we would have
  check if the numerator is divisible by the denominator, which is a modulo operation (slow in modern computing).
  If the remainder was zero, meaning the denominator can divide the numerator, then a integer division operation
  is needed to get the actual integer value of the fraction (not as slow as modulo but still slow compared to multiply
  or add operations). Thus, with the combination of many arithmetic operations to compute the next \(y_k\) and
  many operations to check if that \(y_k\) is a factor, this algorithm will be the slowest.

  Since I used a fraction library, I needed to exploit fractional arithmetic which you learn in Algebra classes that
  seems not too bad. But simplifying fractions takes many operations! Without realizing it, we were doing many
  operations in our head (or at least retrieving from our memory those operations). We gained an intuition into how to simplify arithmetic operations
  with fractions well, but the computer has to do all the steps your brain did subconsciously. So I tried to make my
  fraction library arithmetic operations as quick as possible - performing no optimizations or simplifications. As such,
  the denominators of each consecutive \(y_k\) got larger and larger, because instead of finding the greatest common divisor
  for a fraction subtraction, I just multiplied both fractions by the other fraction's denominator. This gave growth greater
  than factorial. Thus the denominators would increase like 1*2 = 2, 2*3 = 6, 6*2 = 12, 12*4 = 36, 36*4 = ... and the numbers got
  bigger and bigger. So, without performing any simplification to my fractions, my Erlang system couldn't factor a number above 109.
* Conclusions
  Though this theorem doesn't enhance the speedup of factoring algorithms, it gives us great insights into the relationships
  between factors, relationships between each integer below the square root of a number, and great insights into potential
  facts into the mystery into prime numbers. I believe this theorem when studied and thought about over a lifetime will give birth
  to quicker prime number arithmetic operations, a deeper mathematically understanding, and better algorithmic design.
  Just because an algorithm is slow and inefficient doesn't mean that is of no use. Each algorithm enhances our understanding
  of numbers and how they relate to each other. The very facts, axioms, and foundations of mathematics rely on simple
  arithmetic and factoring. The more we understand about those operations as well as high-level mathematics, the better
  citizens we will be. We will be more logical and reasonable. We will have better ideas and more insight. We will
  be able to solve problems faster than those around us. We will make the world a better place.
